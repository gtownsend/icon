 * Icode consists of operators and arguments.  Operators are small integers,

 *  of ints and words (longs).  When an icode file is read in and processed
 *  by the interpreter, it looks like a C array of mixed ints and words.
 *  Accessing this "nonstandard" structure is handled by a union of int and
 *  word pointers and incrementing is done by incrementing the appropriate
 *  member of the union (see the interpreter).  This is a rather dubious
 *  method and certainly not portable.  A better way might be to address
 *  icode with a char *, but the incrementing code might be inefficient
 *  (at a place that experiences a lot of execution activity).
 *
 * For the moment, the dubious coding is isolated under control of the
 *  size of integers.
