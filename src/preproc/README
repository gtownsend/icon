This directory contains files for building pp, a ANSI-C preprocessor for
C (with some extensions).  pp itself is not needed to build the Icon
compiler system -- the files here are automatically incorporated in
rtt.

However, if you want to build a stand-alone version of pp for
some other use, the Makefile here will do it.
