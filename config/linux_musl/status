Comments:

	Tested on x64 Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS with cc 9.3.0 and Linux 4.5.0-112.
	Some spurious warnings were produced by the C compiler.

	Tested on arm7l Beaglebone Debian 10.3 with cc 8.3.0 and Linux 4.19.94.

	The following notes are old and not recently verified:

	With graphics, additional packages are needed:
	$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev libxt-dev libxaw7-dev
	Some compiler warnings are generated when built with graphics.

	Graphics users may also want to add some old-style fonts,
	because Icon can't use client-side font rendering:
	$ sudo apt-get install xfonts-100dpi  [or -75dpi, or both]
