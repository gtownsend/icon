Known bugs:

	None

Comments:

	Tested on x64 Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver).

	Icon without graphics builds and installs cleanly
	on the standard Ubuntu desktop distribution.

	With graphics, additional packages are needed:
	$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev libxt-dev libxaw7-dev
	Some compiler warnings are generated when built with graphics.

	Graphics users may also want to add some old-style fonts,
	because Icon can't use client-side font rendering:
	$ sudo apt-get install xfonts-100dpi  [or -75dpi, or both]
