Purpose
   X-Tiles is a puzzle. You try to score a large number of points by removing
   connected sets of same-colored tiles from a playfield (see manpage)
   X-Tiles serves no purpose whatsoever.

Installation
   You need a working package of the Icon programming language installed
   first. Confere ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/pub/Icon for that.
   Tiles should work as-is with Icon v9.0 and higher. 

   Compile X-Tiles with either icont/iconc as you wish.

   Check that it works.

   Copy the executable and the man page where you want.

Background pictures
   X-Tiles can use background pictures.  The precise formats it can load
   will vary with your Icon installation.  It tries to be reasonably smart,
   but it needs at least 40 colormap entries to be usable in full color 
   mode.  If it does not work, you may try the -reduced mode, or even
   -bw.

   Another possibility is to reduce the picture colormap, to say 200 
   colors. xpaint can do that, for instance (load your picture, and
   use the Filter/Quantize colors menu.

Legalese
   X-Tiles is not public domain. It is freely distributable, except
   for commercial purposes and distributions, in which case you must
   contact the author about it.
