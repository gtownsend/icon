<H2><A NAME="intro">1. Introduction, Acknowledgements and Non-Warranty</A></H2>

<P><EM>itweak</EM> is an Icon interactive debugging utility. The idea is that
you compile your Icon program to ucode files (<tt>.u1</tt>, <tt>.u2</tt>).
<EM>itweak</EM> then tweaks the ucode, inserting potential breakpoints.
The resulting ucode files are linked with a debugging run-time and off
you go.

<P>The <EM>itweak</EM> system provides you with many of the facilities
you would 
expect from an interactive debugger, including the ability to evaluate
a wide range of Icon expressions.
Personally I wouldn't like to be without this tool, but I may be biased.
It can be used both for finding bugs and to convince oneself that an
Icon program indeed works the intended way.

<P><EM>itweak</EM> owes a lot to the pioneering <em>debugify</em> system
by Charles A. Shartsis.
This heritage is gratefully acknowledged. What <EM>itweak</EM>
offers over <em>debugify</em> is radically improved performance (in time as
well as space) and a more fully-fledged run-time system.

<P>The author believes the software is useful but wouldn't imagine it is
free from bugs.
The software is provided "as-is" and without warranty of any kind.
Please send bug reports, change requests, and other comments to the
address above.

<H2><A NAME="prereq">2. Prerequisites</A></H2>

<P><EM>itweak</EM> has been tested with Icon 8.10 and 9.0 under Unix
(SunOS 4.1.4) and DOS.
The software is completely written in Icon, and should be as portable
as Icon itself.

<H2><A NAME="install">3. Installing <EM>itweak</EM></A></H2>

<P>Installation is straightforward.
For Unix there is a makefile that does most of the job.

<H3><A NAME="unix">Unix</A></H3>

<P>Under Unix, type <tt>make</tt> in the installation directory.
The following files are generated.
<DL>
<DT>itweak<DD>an Icon 'executable'.
Copy it to a commonly accessible directory and include it in your
PATH.
<DT>dbg_run.u1, dbg_run.u2
<DD>These files constitute the <em>debugging run-time</em> system which will
be linked with your tweaked programs.
Make the debugging run-time available to the Icon linker by including
its directory in the IPATH environment variable.
Or, alternatively, make sure that the <tt>dbg_run.u</tt> files are
present in the same directory as the program you are going to debug.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="other-platforms">Other Platforms, or Platforms Without Make</A></H3>

<P><EM>itweak</EM> comes with two Icon source files, <tt>itweak.icn</tt> and <tt>dbg_run.icn</tt>.
Run the following command to produce the <EM>itweak</EM> program,
<P><CODE>
  icont itweak.icn
</CODE>
<P>Put <EM>itweak</EM> (the resulting file) in a commonly accessible directory and
include it in your PATH.
(If you can, you should of course use the Icon compiler to produce <EM>itweak</EM>.)
Now run the following command,
<P><CODE>
  icont -c dbg_run.icn
</CODE>
<P>The resulting files (<tt>dbg_run.u1, dbg_run.u2</tt>) constitute the
<em>debugging run-time</em> system which will be linked with your
tweaked programs.

<P>Make the debugging run-time available to the Icon linker by including
its directory in the IPATH environment variable.
Or, alternatively, make sure that the <tt>dbg_run.u</tt> files are
present in the same directory as the program you are going to debug.

<H2><A NAME="samples">4. Debugging Samples</A></H2>

<P>There are at least two ways you may examine <EM>itweak</EM> without
committing yourself too heavily to it.

<H3><A NAME="canned-session">Canned Debugging Session</A></H3>

<P>The <EM>itweak</EM> distribution comes with a demo.
Under Unix, type <tt>make demo</tt> to make it happen.

<P>On other platforms, or on platforms without <EM>make:</EM> do the following commands.
<P><CODE>
  icont -c ipxref.icn<BR>
  icont -c options.icn<BR>
  itweak -o samp_ini.icn ipxref options<BR>
  icont -c samp_ini.icn<BR>
  icont -o sample ipxref.u1 options.u1<BR>
  setenv DBG_INPUT demo.cmd<BR>
  sample ipxref.icn<BR>
</CODE>
<P>The commands compile and tweak a sample program.
The source files are <tt>ipxref.icn</tt> and <tt>options.icn</tt>.
The resulting 'executable' is called <tt>sample</tt>.
The last command runs a canned debugging session.

<P>Debugging commands for the demo are taken from the file <tt>demo.cmd</tt>.
To make the demo more meaningful you should open an editor on
<tt>demo.cmd</tt> and compare it to the output of the debugging session.
The commands are annotated.

<H3><A NAME="sample-commands">Sample Debugging Commands</A></H3>

<P>Read this to get a first impression of what kinds of debugging commands
<EM>itweak</EM> offer.
For reading convenience all commands are spelled out fully.
(Commands may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous.)

<P>Set a breakpoint on a source code line and then let the program run to
its first break.
<P><CODE>
  break 88
  goon
</CODE>
<P>In the following examples we omit the <tt>goon</tt> command which makes
the program continue until the next break (or until it exits).

<P>Print the current value of a simple variable (<tt>word</tt>).
<P><CODE>
  print word
</CODE>
<P>Attach a macro which automatically prints <tt>word</tt> every time we hit
this breakpoint.
<P><CODE>
  do .<BR>
  print word<BR>
  end<BR>
</CODE>
<P>Attach a condition to the breakpoint which causes a break only if
<tt>word</tt> contains the string <tt>buffer</tt>.
<P><CODE>
  cond . word == "buffer"
</CODE>
<P>The dot means <em>the current breakpoint</tt>.

<P>Now some more advanced printing:
Print every value generated by an expression.
This is useful if the variable contains a list, for example.
<P><CODE>
  eprint !resword
</CODE>
<P>You may use subscripting and record field references when printing an
expression:
<P><CODE>
  print prec[1].pname
</CODE>
<P>The printing commands actually accept almost all Icon expressions.
You may invoke procedures or Icon functions, for instance.

<P>You may use the <tt>info</tt> command to get information about a
 breakpoint, source files, local or global variables, among other things:
<P><CODE>
  info break .<BR>
  info files<BR>
  info local<BR>
  info global<BR>
</CODE>
<P>These are not all commands.
Please refer to the special section on
<A HREF="#debug-commands">debugging commands</A>.
The <EM>itweak</EM> on-line help contains details about all available commands.

<H2><A NAME="preparing-debug">5. Preparing for a Debugging Session</A></H2>

<P>In order to debug an Icon program you will need to go through
the following major steps.
These steps assume you have installed <EM>itweak</EM> as described above.
<OL>
<LI>Compile the Icon source files (usually <tt>icont -c</tt>).
<LI>Tweak some or all of the program's ucode files.
<LI>Compile the Icon source file generated by <EM>itweak</EM>.
<LI>Link the tweaked files.
<LI>Run an interactive debugging session.
</OL>

<P>The demo described in the previous section provides an example.
The next few sections go more into detail.

<H3><A NAME="tweak-link">Tweaking and Linking an Icon Program</A></H3>

<P>Let us assume you have a program built from source files named
<tt>alpha.icn</tt>, <tt>beta.icn</tt>, and <tt>gamma.icn</tt>.
Compile all source files, but do not link them yet.
A suitable command is
<P><CODE>
  icont -c alpha.icn beta.icn gamma.icn
</CODE>
<P>This will produce <tt>.u1</tt> and <tt>.u2</tt> (i.e. ucode) files for
each of the source files.

<P>It is not necessary to tweak all files. However, you will be able to set
breakpoints only in tweaked files. In order to illuminate this point, let
us assume you decide to tweak only files <tt>alpha</tt> and <tt>gamma</tt>.
Do this the following way.
Note that the <EM>itweak</EM> command takes base file names, omitting the file
name extension (<tt>.u1</tt>, for example).
<P><CODE>
  itweak alpha gamma
</CODE>
<P>The above command will tweak <tt>alpha.u1</tt> and <tt>gamma.u1</tt> and one of
the <tt>.u2</tt> files.
It is important to tweak the files in a single <EM>itweak</EM> command.
For reasons described in the <A HREF="#quirks-limit">quirks</A> section
the general recommendation is that you include the file containing the
<B>main</B> procedure in the set of tweaked files.

<P>Whenever a ucode file is tweaked the original file is saved under a
different name.
A <tt>.u1</tt> file will have its extension changed to <tt>.u1~</tt>.
A tweaked <tt>.u2</tt> file will have its extension changed to <tt>.u2~</tt>.

<P>Later, when running the program, reference will only be made to source
files, not to ucode files.

<P>The <EM>itweak</EM> command produces an additional Icon file.
Its default name is <tt>dbg_init.icn</tt>.
You may change the name of this file by using the <tt>-o</tt> command line option.
For instance, the following is a possible command,
<P><CODE>
  itweak -o proginit.icn alpha gamma
</CODE>
<P>This command will generate a file named <tt>proginit.icn</tt>, but
otherwise perform the same function as the <EM>itweak</EM> command above.
You must compile the generated Icon file.
The following command does this (now assuming the default name has been used).
<P><CODE>
  icont -c dbg_init.icn
</CODE>
<P>Finally link the program as you would normally do it.
Like this, for instance,
<P><CODE>
  icont alpha.u beta.u gamma.u
</CODE>
<P>The <EM>itweak</EM> command tweaks one of the <tt>.u2</tt> files involved.
It inserts the equivalent of <B>link</B> statements.
This will, in effect, add <tt>dbg_init.icn</tt> and <tt>dbg_run.u</tt> to
the link list.
The <tt>dbg_init.u</tt> files will usually be present in the current
directory.
Of course the <tt>dbg_run.u</tt> files may also reside in the current
directory.
However, it is often more useful to have the run-time files in a
separate directory which is included in the IPATH environment
variable.

If the linkage is successful, the result is an executable program
<tt>alpha</tt> (under Unix).

<H3><A NAME="re-tweaking">Note on Re-Tweaking Files</A></H3>

<P>Usually you would develop a program in an edit-compile-debug cycle.
<EM>itweak</EM> notices if a file is already tweaked and does not tweak it a
second time. Thus you may run the same <EM>itweak</EM> command after you have
modified and compiled just one of the source files. This means the
<EM>itweak</EM> command is suited for inclusion in a Makefile.

<H3><A NAME="quirks-limit"><EM>itweak</EM> Quirks and Limitations</A></H3>

<P><EM>itweak</EM> and the debugging run-time introduce numerous
global names for its own use.
A common prefix is used on all such names to minimize the risk of name
clashes with your program.
The prefix is '<tt>__dbg_</tt>' (beginning with a double underscore).
It is, of course, possible for the target program to interfere with
the debugging run-time, possibly causing it to crash.

<P><EM>itweak</EM> detects the <B>main</B> Icon procedure of your program.
It inserts code for executing a parameterless procedure named
<tt>__dbg_init</tt> before anything else.
This procedure initializes the run-time environment.
(The procedure is generated by <EM>itweak</EM> as part of the <tt>dbg_init.icn</tt> file.)

<P>If you omit the file containing <B>main</B> from the set of tweaked
files you must modify your program to invoke <tt>__dbg_init</tt> before
execution reaches a tweaked file.
Otherwise the program will terminate with a run-time error.

<P>This is one reason why tweaked ucode files are not suited for shared
libraries.
Tweaking a file in a way marks it for a particular program.
You (or somebody else) may attempt to tweak the same file in order to
use it in a different program, but <EM>itweak</EM> will not touch it,
because it has been tweaked already.
There will probably be a conflict at linkage time, however: <em>__dbg_init:
inconsistent redeclaration</em>.
What you have to do in this case is erase the ucode files and
recompile and tweak from scratch.

<P>For each tweaked file <EM>itweak</EM> creates a global variable
holding a set of active breakpoints.
The name of this variable contains the base name of the file.
This limits file names to the syntax accepted as Icon identifiers.

<H2><A NAME="debug-session">6. The Debugging Session</A></H2>

<P>This section describes what a debugging session looks like.

<H3><A NAME="start-session">Starting a Debugging Session</A></H3>

<P>After having tweaked and linked your program according to the
description above you should be able to start it as usual.
It will behave slightly different, however.
After starting up a '<tt>$</tt>' prompt will appear (on standard error).
The prompt means you are expected to enter a debugging command (on
standard input).

<P>Detailed command descriptions are available on-line through the
<tt>help</tt> command.
Type <tt>help</tt> to see a list of available commands.
Type <tt>help <i>command</i></tt> to get a description of a particular
command.

<H3><A NAME="env-variables">Run-Time Environment Variables</A></H3>

<P>Environment variables may be used to re-direct debugging
input and output.

<DL>
<DT>DBG_INPUT<DD>if set to a file name will cause debugging commands
to be read from the file.
If end-of-file is encountered remaining commands will be taken from
standard input.

<DT>DBG_OUTPUT<DD>if set to a file name will cause debugging output to
be written to the file.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="debug-commands">Debugging Commands: Overview</A></H3>

<P>The debugging commands will enable you to control and monitor the
execution of your program.
This section contains general information and some examples.
Detailed descriptions are available on-line through the <tt>help</tt> command.

<H4><A NAME="keyw-abbrev">Keyword Abbreviations</A></H4>

<P>All debugging command keywords may be abbreviated as long as the
abbreviation is unambiguous.
For instance, <tt>goon nobreak</tt> may usually be written <tt>g no</tt>.

<P>The reason we say <em>usually</em> is that you may define new commands
by means of the <tt>macro</tt> command.
Macro names are subject to the same abbreviation rules as built-in
commands.

<H4><A NAME="breakpoints">Breakpoints</A></H4>

<H5><A NAME="setting-clearing-brk">Setting and Clearing a Breakpoint</A></H5>

<P>The <tt>break</tt> command defines a breakpoint on a source line or on a
number of consecutive source lines.
The break will take effect <B>after</B> the expression on the source
line has been evaluated.
(This is a difference from most other debuggers where breaks occur
before the source line is executed.)

<P>In some cases the break occurs in a slightly different place from
where you would expect it.
This is the reason the <tt>break</tt> command optionally covers more
than one source line.
By setting breakpoints on a few lines around the interesting spot you
may make sure that there really is a break.

<P>A source line cannot have more than one breakpoint.
Each <tt>break</tt> command silently supersedes any previous breakpoints
it happens to overlap.

The <tt>clear breakpoint</tt> removes a breakpoint.

<H5><A NAME="identifying-brk">Identifying Breakpoints</A></H5>

<P>A breakpoint is identified by a small integer, the <em>breakpoint
number</em>.
The <tt>break</tt> command prints the breakpoint number of the
breakpoint it creates.
The breakpoint number can be used in other debugging commands.

<P>You may identify a breakpoint by its literal breakpoint number, or by
the special symbols '<tt>.</tt>' (dot) and '<tt>$</tt>' (dollar).
Dot means the <em>current</em> breakpoint, i.e. the breakpoint that
caused the current break.
Dollar means the <em>last</em> breakpoint defined by a <tt>break</tt>
command.

<P>Use the <tt>info breakpoint</tt> command to see the definition of a
breakpoint (or all breakpoints).

<H5><A NAME="tailoring-brk">Tailoring a Breakpoint</A></H5>

<P>A plain breakpoint as created by <tt>break</tt> is unconditional.
There are several ways you may modify its behavior to suit your needs.

<UL>
<LI>The <tt>ignore</tt> command sets an <em>ignore counter</em> on a
breakpoint.
A breakpoint having a non-zero ignore counter does not cause a break
when execution runs into it.
Instead of causing a break the ignore counter is decremented by one.
Setting an ignore counter to a negative value effectively disables
the breakpoint.

<LI>The <tt>condition</tt> command defines a condition for a
breakpoint.
The condition will be evaluated each time execution reaches the
breakpoint.
If the condition fails the breakpoint does not cause a break.

<LI>The <tt>do</tt> command attaches an anonymous macro (one or more
debugging commands) to a breakpoint.
The macro is executed whenever the breakpoint causes a break.
</UL>

<P>When a plain break occurs a special macro called the <em>prelude</em> is
executed.
The standard prelude prints the breakpoint number and the location of
the breakpoint.
In a similar way a special macro called the <em>postlude</em> is
executed just before execution is resumed after a break.
The standard postlude is empty.

<P>The prelude and postlude are ordinary macros which you may redefine by
means of the <tt>set</tt> command.

<P>Note that the prelude is not executed if a break is caused by a
breakpoint with a <tt>do</tt> macro.

<H5><A NAME="brk-0">Breakpoint 0 (Zero)</A></H5>

<P>Breakpoint zero is special.
The <tt>next</tt> debugging command causes a break to occur after the
next source line has been executed (or after a specified number of
lines).
A break caused by a <tt>next</tt> command is treated as if defined by
breakpoint number zero.
(This is the case even if there is an ordinary breakpoint on the same
source line.)
Breakpoint number zero may be assigned a condition, a <tt>do</tt> macro,
or an ignore count, just like other breakpoints.
It may not be cleared, however.

<H4><A NAME="expressions">Expressions</A></H4>

<P>Expressions may be included in the various print commands and in
breakpoint conditions.
Expressions may be formed from
<UL>
<LI>a large subset of Icon operators, including subscripting and
record field references,
<LI>integer, string, list literals,
<LI>locals from the current procedure,
<LI>globals,
<LI>procedure and function invocations,
<LI>a subset of the Icon keywords.
</UL>

<P>A few keywords have been added or altered:
<DL>
<DT>&amp;bp, &amp;breakpoint<DD>The breakpoint number of the current
breakpoint (integer).

<DT>&amp;file<DD>The source file name of the current breakpoint (string).

<DT>&amp;line<DD>The source line number of the current breakpoint (integer).

<DT>&amp;proc<DD>The name of the procedure where the current breakpoint
occurred (string).
</DL>

<P>Expression evaluation is guarded by error conversion.
An Icon error during evaluation should cause a conflict message, but
not terminate the program.

<H4><A NAME="printing-cmd">Commands for Printing</A></H4>

<P>There are several debugging commands for evaluating and printing
expressions.

<P>The <tt>print</tt> command takes any number of expressions separated by
semicolon.
The command evaluates and prints the image of the first value returned
by each expression.
This is a common way to inspect variables, for instance.

<P>The <tt>eprint</tt> command (<em>e</em> as in <B>every</B>) takes a single
expression and prints the image of every value it generates.
The following example shows a simple way of printing the contents of a
list,
<P><CODE>
  eprint !mylist
</CODE>
<P>The <tt>fprint</tt> command (<em>f</em> as in <em>format</em>)
expects a format string followed by any number of expressions.
The format string can be any expression returning a string-convertible
value.
The expressions must be separated by semicolon.
The format string may contain placeholders.
The remaining expressions are expected to return values to insert into
the format string, replacing the placeholders.
In this case the actual value is used, not the image.
A conflict is generated if any of the values is not
string-convertible, so you may have to use the <B>image</B> function,
or some other explicit conversion.

<P>The <tt>fprint</tt> command is useful when you care about the appearance
of the output.

<P>The <tt>fprint</tt> command does not print a newline unless it is
explicitly included in the output.
Usually it can be inserted at the end of the format string.

<P>A format string placeholder is basically a percent (<tt>%</tt>) character
followed by a digit 1-9.
Thus there can be up to nine different placeholders.
A particular placeholder ('<tt>%1</tt>' for example) may occur any
number of times.
Each occurrence of '<tt>%1</tt>' will be replaced by the value of the
first expression after the format string.
Each occurrence of '<tt>%2</tt>' will be replaced by the value of the
second expression after the format string, and so on.

<P>A plain placeholder represents a variable-length field.
It is possible to specify a fixed-length field.
Add '<tt>&lt;</tt>' for a left-justified, or '<tt>></tt>' for a
right-justified field.
Also add the length of the field.
For instance, '<tt>%1&lt;20</tt>' defines a left-justified field with a fixed
length of 20 characters.

<P>To print a percent character, double the character in the format
string (<tt>%%</tt>).
Backslash (<tt>\</tt>) can also be used to quote other characters.

<P>A placeholder for which there is no value is silently replaced by its
placeholder number.

<H3><A NAME="run-quirks-limit">Run-Time Quirks, Limitations</A></H3>

<P>The <EM>itweak</EM> algorithm for deciding source line limits is
rather simple-minded.
This is the reason breaks do not always occur exactly where you
expect.

<P>The implementation of the alternation (<tt>|</tt>) control structure is
naive; works only in simple cases.
(See <cite>The Icon Analyst,</cite> Number 23, April 1994.)

<P>It is currently not possible to list macro definitions (including
<tt>do</tt> macros).

<P>A few commands use the <em>display file</em>: <tt>frame, info globals,
where</tt>.
The display file is simply the output from the <B>display</B> Icon
function.
Writing the display file requires write permission in the current
directory.

<P>It should be possible to negate a breakpoint condition, but this is
not implemented yet.

<P>It is possible to invoke a target program procedure in an expression.
This can be useful for side effects.
The run-time is not fully re-entrant, however, so if there is a
breakpoint in the procedure the run-time may get confused when it
returns.
(No fatal error should occur.)

<P>Escaping characters in <tt>fprint</tt> format strings do not always work.
Beware of the following format string.
It generates a long, long output.
<CODE>"foo/year=%1<20\1994\n"</CODE>

<H2><A NAME="performance">7. Performance Considerations</A></H2>

<P>My main dissatisfaction with the <em>debugify</em> package was
performance.
Thus a lot of effort has gone into finding ways to minimize the
debugging overhead.
The following performance measurements were made on a Sun SPARCstation
IPC under SunOS 4.1.3 with 24 Mb of memory.

<P>A tweaked ucode file will be less than 2 times the size of the
untweaked file (<em>debugify:</em> 5 times).
A tweaked program without any breakpoints (<tt>goon nobreak</tt>) runs
approximately 4 times slower than an untweaked program
(<em>debugify:</em> 200 times; this easily becomes unbearable).
The <EM>itweak</EM> program itself runs at over 3 times the speed of
<em>debugify</em>.

<P>The increased performance carries a certain cost: Only a single
potential breakpoint is created per source line.
No provision is made for setting variables.
The code is not executable unless certain global variables (created by
<EM>itweak</EM>) have been initialized.

<P>Debugging commands are compiled to an internal representation as they
are entered.
This is especially important for expressions.
Expressions are parsed with simple string matching, backtracking and
all.
They are immediately unwound and converted to a postfix notation.
This means that breakpoint conditions and macros can be evaluated
efficiently.

<H2><A NAME="impl-notes">8. Implementation Notes (The Hidden Art of Tweaking)</A></H2>

<P>The Icon source code generated by <EM>itweak</EM> mainly creates and initializes
a number of global variables.
An Icon <B>set</B> is created for each tweaked source file.
The sets are used to hold breakpoint line numbers.

<P><EM>itweak</EM> creates a potential breakpoint on every source line
it finds in the ucode file.
A potential breakpoint consists of code testing the current line
number against the set of breakpoint line numbers for the
current source file.

<P>If the test says 'yes' then a jump is made to code added at the end of
the current procedure.
This code collects the values and names of all locals and calls the
debugging run-time.
The same code is used for all potential breakpoints in one procedure.
This means that besides potential breakpoints a chunk of code is added
at the end of every procedure.

<P>A global variable named <tt>__dbg_test</tt> is used to test for
breakpoints.
It may be set to different Icon functions to achieve various effects.
The function will be called with two parameters: a set of breakpoint
line numbers and an integer line number.
The following values are currently used,

<DL>
<DT>member<DD>This is the initial value.
The effect is to check if there is a breakpoint on the current line.

<DT>integer<DD>Always fails (since a set cannot be converted to an
integer).
Used to implement the <tt>goon nobreak</tt> command.

<DT>2<DD>(integer 2)
The effect is to cause the second parameter to be returned.
Hence always succeeds.
Used to implement the <tt>next</tt> command which causes a break on
every potential breakpoint.
</DL>

<P>The debugging run-time is a procedure.
It must fail in order not to disturb the logic of the current
procedure.

<P>It surprises me that it is possible to do this amount of tweaking to
an Icon program.
I have debugged fairly complex programs without noticing any
unexpected weirdness (like tweaked program logic).
However, <EM>itweak</EM> as a whole is a case of reverse engineering.
Someone with greater theoretical insight may be able to detect cracks
in the tweaking scheme.
Please tell me in such case.
