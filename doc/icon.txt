ICON(1)                                                                ICON(1)

NAME
       icon - execute Icon program

SYNOPSIS
       icon sourcefile [ arg ... ]
       icon -P 'program' [ arg ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Icon  is  a simple interface for executing programs written in the Icon
       programming language.  The source code is translated and  linked,  then
       executed with the given list of arguments.

       Without  -P,  a  single  source  file  is  read; its name must be given
       exactly and need not end in .icn.  A sourcefile name  of  -  reads  the
       source code from standard input.

       With  -P, a small program can be embedded within a larger shell script.
       In this case the program argument is a complete Icon program, typically
       given as a multi-line quoted string.

       Translation  and  linking is silent, suppressing progress messages, and
       undeclared identifiers are diagnosed.  This mirrors the behavior of the
       icont command when run with -s and -u options.

       An  Icon  source  file  can  be made directly executable by setting the
       appropriate permission bits and beginning it with a shell  header.   If
       the first line of the file is
            #!/usr/bin/env icon
       then icon is found on the command search path and called to process the
       program upon execution.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variables described under icont(1)  can  also  be  used
       with the icon command.  Normally, none of these are needed.  The direc-
       tory containing sourcefile is searched first for any $include files.
