NAME
       icont - translate Icon program

SYNOPSIS
       icont [ option ... ] file ... [ -x arg ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Icont  translates  and  links  programs  written  in the Icon language.
       Translation produces ucode files,  suffixed  .u1  and  .u2,  which  are
       linked to produce executable files.  Icon executables are shell scripts
       containing binary data; this data is interpreted by iconx,  which  must
       be present at execution time.

       File names ending in .icn are Icon source files; the .icn suffix may be
       omitted from command arguments.  An argument of - reads  from  standard
       input.   A name ending in .u, .u1, or .u2 selects both files of a ucode
       pair.  The specified files are combined to produce  a  single  program,
       which is named by removing the suffix from the first input file.

       An  argument  of  -x may appear after the file arguments to execute the
       linked program.  Any subsequent arguments are passed to the program.

       Ucode files produced by translation are normally deleted after linking.
       If  the  -c option is given, processing stops after translation and the
       ucode files are left behind.  A directory of such files functions as  a
       linkable library.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by icont:

       -c  Stop after producing ucode files.

       -f s
           Enable full string invocation by preserving unreferenced procedures
           during linking.

       -o file
           Write the executable program to the specified file.

       -p  Enable execution-time profiling; implied if ICONPROFILE is set  and
           not empty.

       -s  Suppress informative messages during translation and linking.

       -t  Activate runtime tracing by arranging for &trace to have an initial
           value of -1 upon execution.

       -u  Diagnose undeclared identifiers.

       -v i
           Set verbosity level of informative messages to i.

       -E  Direct the results of preprocessing to standard output and  inhibit
           further processing.

       -N  Don't embed iconx path in executable file.

       -V  Announce version and configuration information on standard error.

TRANSLATION ENVIRONMENT
       Two  environment variables control file search paths during translation
       and linking.  These variables contain blank- or  colon-separated  lists
       of  directories  to  be searched after the current directory and before
       the standard library.

       IPATH
           Directories to search for for ucode files specified in link  direc-
           tives and on the command line.

       LPATH
           Directories  to  search  for source files specified in preprocessor
           $include directives.

EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT
       Several environment variables control the execution of an Icon program.
       Values in parentheses are the default values.

       BLKSIZE (500000)
           The initial size, in bytes, of the allocated block region.

       COEXPSIZE (2000)
           The size, in words, of each co-expression stack.

       ICONCORE
           If set, a core dump is produced for error termination.

       ICONPROFILE
           If  set,  specifies  a file to which profiling data is written upon
           termination of a program linked with the  -p  option.   The  output
           reports timer ticks and visit counts for each line executed.

       ICONX
           The  location  of iconx, the icon interpreter, overriding the value
           built into the executable by icont.  Not required if the configura-
           tion  is  unchanged  since  build  time  or if iconx is in the same
           directory as the executable.

       MSTKSIZE (10000)
           The size, in words, of the main interpreter stack for icont.

       NOERRBUF
           By default, &errout is buffered.  If this variable is set,  &errout
           is not buffered.

       QLSIZE (5000)
           The size, in bytes, of the region used for pointers to strings dur-
           ing garbage collection.

       STRSIZE (500000)
           The initial size, in bytes, of the string space.

       TRACE
           The initial value of &trace.  If this  variable  has  a  value,  it
           overrides the translation-time -t option.

CAVEATS
       Icon executables are not self-sufficient, but require the iconx  inter-
       preter.   When distributing an Icon program in executable form, include
       a copy of iconx in the same directory.
