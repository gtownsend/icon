<HR><H2>Learning about Icon</H2>

<H3><A NAME="whatsicon">A1.</A> What is Icon?</H3>
<P>
Icon is a very high level general-purpose programming language with
extensive features for processing strings (text) and data structures.
Icon is an imperative, procedural language with a syntax that is
reminiscent of C and Pascal, but with semantics at a much higher level.
<P>
Icon has a novel expression-evaluation mechanism that integrates
goal-directed evaluation and backtracking with conventional control structures.
It has a string scanning facility for pattern matching that avoids the tedious
details usually associated with analyzing strings.
Icon's built-in data structures include sets and tables with associative
lookup, lists that can be used as vectors or stacks and queues, and records.
<P>
Icon is a strongly, though not statically, typed language.
It provides transparent automatic type conversion:
For example, if an integer is used in an operation that requires a string,
the integer is automatically converted to a string.
<P>
Most implementations of Icon have high-level graphics facilities with
an easily programmed window interface.
<P>
Icon manages storage automatically.
Objects are created as needed during program execution and space is
reclaimed by garbage collection as needed.
The sizes of strings and data structures are limited only by the amount
of available memory.

<H3><A NAME="whatgood">A2.</A> What is Icon good for?</H3>
<P>
As a general-purpose programming language with a large computational
repertoire, Icon can be used for most programming tasks.
It's especially strong at building software tools, for processing text,
and for experimental and research applications.
<P>
Icon is designed to make programming easy;
it emphasizes the value of programmer's
time and the importance of getting programs to work quickly.
Consequently, Icon is used both for short, one-shot tasks and for
very complex applications.

<H3><A NAME="library">A4.</A> What is the Icon program library?</H3>
<P>
The library is a collection of programs and procedures written in Icon.
User contributions form a significant portion of the library.
<P>
Library procedures effectively augment the built-in functions
available to an Icon program.
A wide variety of procedures currently exists, and most
graphically-based programs are built around library procedures.
The <A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/library/src/procs/core.icn">core</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/library/src/gprocs/graphics.icn">
graphics core</A> modules are the most carefully vetted.
<P>
The programs in the library range from simple demonstrations to
handy tools to complex graphical applications.
<P>
The library is a resource for both new and experienced programmers.
In addition to their basic utility,
its programs and procedures serve as examples of how things can be
written in Icon.
<P>
The library is indexed at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/library/ipl.htm">
www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/library/ipl.htm</A>.


<H3><A NAME="intro">A5.</A> Where can I learn more about Icon?</H3>
<P>
There is lots of material at the Icon website,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/">www.cs.arizona.edu/icon</A>.
<P>
Here are some good places to start:
<UL>
<LI> Ralph Griswold's overview:
	<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/docs/ipd266.htm">
	www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/docs/ipd266.htm</A>
<LI> Dave Hanson's introduction:
	<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/intro.htm">

<LI> Bill Mitchell's introduction and slides:
	<A HREF="http://www.mitchellsoftwareengineering.com/icon/">
	www.mitchellsoftwareengineering.com/icon</A>
</UL>
<P>
For a more thorough introduction to the base language,
chapter 2 of the Icon 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/gb/">graphics book</A>
(a free download) is especially good.
<P>
For a whirlwind tour of the graphics facilities, see:

</UL>

<H3><A NAME="examples">A6.</A> Where are some simple examples?</H3>
<P>
For some simple text-based programs, see any of those
introductory documents in the preceding question.
For some simple graphics programs, see
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/gb/progs/progs.htm">
www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/gb/progs/progs.htm</A>.
<P>
Many more examples, typically larger, are found in the
Icon program library; see the indexes of
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/library/cprogs.htm">Basic Programs</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/library/cgprogs.htm">
Graphics Programs</A>.

<H3><A NAME="documentation">A7.</A> How about comprehensive documentation?</H3>
<P>
Two books define the Icon language.
The core language is covered in
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/lb3.htm">
<CITE>The Icon Programming Language (third edition)</CITE></A>,
by Griswold and Griswold.
Graphics facilities are described in
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/gb/">
<CITE>Graphics Programming in Icon</CITE></A>
by Griswold, Jeffery, and Townsend.
These books contain both tutorial and reference material.
<P>
Icon's internals are detailed in
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/ibsale.htm">
<CITE>The Implementation of the Icon Programming Language</CITE></A>
by Griswold and Griswold.
Although considerable changes have occurred since Version 6,
described in the book, the basic structure of Icon remains the same.
Two technical reports,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/docs/ipd112.htm">IPD112</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/docs/ipd239.htm">IPD239</A>,
describe subsequent changes.
<P>
Printed copies of the
<CITE>Language</CITE> and <CITE>Graphics</CITE> books
are available from Jeffery Books
(<A HREF="http://unicon.org/books/">http://unicon.org/books/</A>).
All three books can be downloaded at no charge from the Icon books page, 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/books.htm">
www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/books.htm</A>.
<P>
A 2010 revision of the book <CITE>Icon Programming for Humanists</CITE>, 
by Alan Corr&eacute;, is also available for purchase or download from
<A HREF="http://unicon.org/books/">Jeffery Books</A>.
<P>
The <CITE>Icon Programming Language Handbook</CITE>,
by Thomas W. Christopher, is available on the web at

<P>
There is a large amount of additional information at the
Icon web site,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/">www.cs.arizona.edu/icon</A>,

<HR><H2>Implementations</H2>

<H3><A NAME="platforms">B1.</A> What platforms support Icon?</H3>
<P>
The primary implementation of Icon is written for Unix-based systems.
These include Linux, BSD, Solaris, Macintosh, Haiku, and the
<A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</A> environment under Windows.
Version 9.5 of Icon has been tested on all these platforms.
<P>
A native implementation for
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v95w.htm">Windows</A>,
derived from this code, is available in binary form.
An alternative Java-based implementation for Unix,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/jcon/">Jcon</A>,
is also available.
Older versions for other systems are also hosted on the Icon website.
<P>
Icon does not provide a window-based development environment.
While Icon programs can open windows and use graphics,
programming is done using editors and other tools from a command shell.

<H3><A NAME="getstarted">B2.</A> How do I get started with Icon?</H3>
<P>
Icon is distributed in source form from GitHub at
<A HREF="https://github.com/gtownsend/icon">github.com/gtownsend/icon</A>.
A copy can be downloaded and built without learning Git.
Select the "Download ZIP" pulldown from the green "↓ Code" button.
<P>
The most recent prebuilt Unix release can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v95u.htm">
www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v95u.htm</A>.
Source and binary packages are available, each with the
complete Icon program library.
<P>
The Windows implementation is at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v95w.htm">
www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v95w.htm</A>.
<P>
For other implementations, start at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/implver.htm">
www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/implver.htm</A>.

<H3><A NAME="unicode">B3.</A> Is there a Unicode version of Icon?</H3>
<P>
No.
Icon is defined in terms of 8-bit characters, and changing this presents
several design challenges that would likely break existing programs.
Modifying the C implementation is probably infeasible anyway,
although a Unicode version of Jcon might be possible.
<P>
The clever design of UTF-8, the usual Unicode encoding,
allows code such as <CODE>write("E♭F♯G♮")</CODE> to work;
but to Icon, <CODE>"E♭F♯G♮"</CODE> is a string of length 12 because
the music accidentals ♭♯♮ are encoded in three bytes each.

<H3><A NAME="iconc">B4.</A> What happened to the compiler?</H3>
<P>
For a while, Unix distributions included both an interpreter and a compiler.
The compiler was an interesting research project but it has not been
maintained and is no longer supported.
The interpreter is much easier to use and is generally quite fast enough,
even for production applications.

<HR><H2>Administration</H2>

<H3><A NAME="iconproject">C1.</A> What is the Icon Project?</H3>
<P>
The Icon Project name identifies the group that
distributes and supports the Icon programming language.
A non-commercial organization, the project is supported by the
Department of Computer Science at the University of Arizona.
<P> Gregg Townsend, now retired from Arizona, maintains the
Unix implementation and the Icon website.
Carl Sturtivant of the University of Minnesota maintains
the native Windows implementation and the Cygwin port.

<H3><A NAME="updates">C2.</A> How often is the on-line material updated?</H3>
<P>
Web pages and other files are updated occasionally,
on an unscheduled basis, when warranted.
<P>
The Icon implementation is now in maintenance mode.
No more formal releases are currently planned,
but one is not precluded should a compelling reason arise.

<H3><A NAME="lineage">C3.</A> Where did Icon come from?</H3>
<P>
Icon is the latest in a series of high-level programming languages designed
to facilitate programming tasks involving strings and structures.
The original language, SNOBOL, was developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories
in the early 1960s.
SNOBOL evolved into SNOBOL4, which is still in use.
Subsequent languages were developed at the University of
Arizona with support from the National Science Foundation.
Although it has similar objectives and many similar capabilities,
Icon bears little superficial resemblance to SNOBOL4.
<P>
Icon implementations were developed by faculty, staff, and students
at the University of Arizona,
with significant contributions from volunteers around the world.
An <A HREF="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/155360.155363">Icon history</A>
by Ralph and Madge Griswold appears in the preprints
of the second History of Programming Languages Conference (HOPL-II),
ACM SIGPLAN Notices, March 1993 (Vol 28, No 3).
<P>
The name Icon is not an acronym, nor does it stand for anything in
particular, although the word <CITE>iconoclastic</CITE> was mentioned
when the name was chosen.
The name predates the now common use of <CITE>icon</CITE>
to refer to small images used in graphical user interfaces.
This sometimes misleads people into thinking
that Icon is designed to create or manipulate icons,
but there's no good solution to that problem.

<H3><A NAME="futures">C4.</A> Where is Icon going? </H3>
<P>
We continue to use Icon on a daily basis, but no significant changes
are planned.
We expect to support the Unix version for the foreseeable future,
and to distribute ports to other systems as supplied by volunteers.
<P>
The Unicon project continues to develop an object-oriented language
based on Icon.  For more information, see
<A HREF="http://unicon.sourceforge.io/">unicon.sourceforge.io</A>.

<HR><H2>Programming</H2>

<H3><A NAME="evread">D1.</A>
Why doesn't <CODE>read()</CODE> work with <CODE>every</CODE>?</H3>
<P>
<CODE>every s := read() do {...}</CODE>
doesn't loop because <CODE>read()</CODE> produces a single value and
then fails if resumed.
Other "consumer" procedures such as <CODE>get()</CODE> and <CODE>pop()</CODE>
work the same way.
Use a <CODE>while</CODE> loop with these procedures, and save
<CODE>every</CODE> for use with generators such as <CODE>!x</CODE>
or <CODE>key(T)</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="strinv">D2.</A>
Why doesn't string invocation such as <CODE>"foo"()</CODE> work?</H3>
<P>
String invocation works if the procedure is present;
the catch is that the linker removes unreferenced procedures.
To ensure a procedure's presence, reference it in the
<CODE>main()</CODE> procedure.
A simple reference suffices, as in
<CODE>refs := [foo, bar, baz]</CODE>;
it's not necessary to actually call it.
<P>
(Why does the linker remove unreferenced procedures?
Because that <EM>greatly</EM> reduces the memory requirements of
programs that use the library.
There was a time when this mattered.)

<H3><A NAME="callc">D3.</A> How can I call a C function?</H3>
<P>
You can't call an arbitrary C function, but you can load and call one
that is written to Icon's specifications.
A tutorial appears in
<a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/analyst/backiss/IA36.pdf">
Icon Analyst 36</a>.
Some examples can be found in the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/library/ccfuncs.htm">
<CODE>cfuncs</CODE></A> and
<CODE>packs/loadfuncs</CODE> directories of the Icon program library.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/jcon/">Jcon</A> implementation
allows Icon programs to call Java code that is written to Jcon specifications.

<H3><A NAME="rwpipe">D4.</A> Can I open a bidirectional pipe?</H3>
<P>
No, this is not possible.
Although the concept is simple &mdash; 
write a line to a program via a pipe, then read that program's output
&mdash; it probably wouldn't work.
Most I/O libraries don't write anything to a pipe until
they've filled a buffer, and the most likely consequence would be
a deadlock, with each program waiting for the other to send more data.
