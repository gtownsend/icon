<H3><A NAME="whatsicon">A1.</A> What is Icon?</H3>
<P>
Icon is a very high level general-purpose programming language with
extensive features for processing strings (text) and data structures.
Icon is an imperative, procedural language with a syntax that is
reminiscent of C and Pascal, but with semantics at a much higher level.
<P>
Icon has a novel expression-evaluation mechanism that integrates
goal-directed evaluation and backtracking with conventional control structures.
It has a string scanning facility for pattern matching that avoids the tedious
details usually associated with analyzing strings.
Icon's built-in data structures include sets and tables with associative
lookup, lists that can be used as vectors or stacks and queues, and records.
<P>
Icon is a strongly, though not statically, typed language.
It provides transparent automatic type conversion:
For example, if an integer is used in an operation that requires a string,
the integer is automatically converted to a string.
<P>
Several implementations of Icon have high-level graphics facilities with
an easily programmed window interface.
<P>
Icon manages storage automatically.
Objects are created as needed during program execution and space is
reclaimed by garbage collection as needed.
The sizes of strings and data structures are limited only by the amount
of available memory.

<H3><A NAME="whatgood">A2.</A> What is Icon good for?</H3>
<P>
As a general-purpose programming language with a large computational
repertoire, Icon can be used for most programming tasks.
It's especially strong at building software tools, for processing text,
and for experimental and research applications.
<P>
Icon is designed to make programming easy;
it emphasizes the value of programmer's
time and the importance of getting programs to work quickly.
Consequently, Icon is used both for short, one-shot tasks and for
very complex applications.

<H3><A NAME="library">A3.</A> What is the Icon program library?</H3>
<P>
The library is a collection of programs and procedures written in Icon.
User contributions are welcome and form a significant portion of the library.
<P>
Library procedures effectively augment the built-in functions
available to an Icon program.
A wide variety of procedures currently exists, and most
graphically-based programs are built around library procedures.
<P>
The programs in the library range from simple demonstrations to
handy tools to complex graphical applications.
<P>
The library is a resource for both new and experienced programmers.
In addition to their basic utility,
its programs and procedures serve as examples of how things can be
written in Icon.

<H3><A NAME="intro">A4.</A> Where can I learn more about Icon?</H3>
<P>
Here are some good places to start.

<H3><A NAME="documentation">A5.</A> How about comprehensive documentation?</H3>
<P>
The definitive work is
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/lb3.htm">
<CITE>The Icon Programming Language</CITE></A> (third edition)
by Griswold and Griswold
(<A HREF="http://www.peer-to-peer.com/">Peer-to-Peer Communications</A>,
1996).
It contains both tutorial and reference material.
<P>
Graphics facilities are described in
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/gb/">
<CITE>Graphics Programming in Icon</CITE></A>
by Griswold, Jeffery, and Townsend
(<A HREF="http://www.peer-to-peer.com/">Peer-to-Peer Communications</A>, 1998).
Again, both tutorial and reference material is included.
<P>
Icon's internals are detailed in
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/ibsale.htm">
<CITE>The Implementation of the Icon Programming Language</CITE></A>
by Griswold and Griswold (Princeton, 1986).
Remaining copies are available from The Icon Project.
Although considerable changes have occurred since Version 6,
described in the book, the basic structure is the same,
and technical reports describing recent implementation changes
are included.
<P>
The <CITE>Icon Programming Language Handbook</CITE>,
by Thomas W. Christopher, is available on the web at
<A HREF="http://www.toolsofcomputing.com/freesoftware.htm">
http://www.toolsofcomputing.com/freesoftware.htm</A>.
<P>
There is a large amount of additional information at the
Icon web site,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/">http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon</A>,
but there is no complete on-line documentation.

<P><HR><H2>Downloading</H2>

<H3><A NAME="platforms">B1.</A> What platforms support Icon?</H3>
Version 9.3 implementations are available for Unix, Windows, and
MS-DOS.
The Unix and Windows implementations include graphics support.
Somewhat older versions, without graphics, are available for the
Macintosh and other systems.
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/jcon/">Jcon</A>, an alternative
Java-based implementation for Unix, is also available.
These Icon implementations were developed at the University of Arizona,
with significant contributions from volunteers around the world.

<H3><A NAME="getstarted">B2.</A> How do I get started with Icon?</H3>
Version 9.3 of Icon can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v93.htm">
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v93.htm</A>.
Full source code is available, and
prebuilt binaries are available for many systems.
<P>
For older implementations, start at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/implver.htm">
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/implver.htm</A>.
Jcon is at <A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/jcon/">
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/jcon/</A>.
<P>
The Icon program library is packaged separately.
See

<P><HR><H2>Administration</H2>

<H3><A NAME="iconproject">C1.</A> What is the Icon Project?</H3>
<P>
The Icon Project is a name used by the group that
distributes and supports the Icon programming language.
The project maintains the Icon web site at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/">http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon</A>.
A non-commercial organization, the project derives support from
the University of Arizona, revenue from book sales,
and user contributions.

<H3><A NAME="updates">C2.</A> How often is the on-line material updated?</H3>
<P>
New material is added when it's available.
Established implementations usually are updated only when there's a
new version.
This typically is every year or two.
The Icon program library is updated on a similar schedule.

<H3><A NAME="lineage">C3.</A> Where did Icon come from?</H3>
<P>
Icon is the latest in a series of high-level programming languages designed
to facilitate programming tasks involving strings and structures.
The original language, SNOBOL, was developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories
in the early 1960s.
SNOBOL evolved into SNOBOL4, which is still in use.
Subsequent languages were developed at the University of
Arizona with support from the National Science Foundation.
Although it has similar objectives and many similar capabilities,
Icon bears little superficial resemblance to SNOBOL4.
<P>
The name Icon is not an acronym, nor does it stand for anything in
particular, although the word <CITE>iconoclastic</CITE> was mentioned
when the name was chosen.
The name predates the now common use of <CITE>icon</CITE>
to refer to small images used in graphical user interfaces.
This sometimes misleads people into thinking that
that Icon is designed to create or manipulate icons,
but there's no good solution to that problem.

<H3><A NAME="futures">C4.</A> Where is Icon going? </H3>
<P>
We continue to use Icon on a daily basis, but no significant changes
are planned.
We expect to support the Unix version for the forseeable future,
and to distribute ports to other systems as supplied by volunteers.
<P>
The Unicon project at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas,
is developing an object-oriented language based on Icon.
For more information, see
<A HREF="http://icon.cs.unlv.edu/">http://icon.cs.unlv.edu/</A>.
An earlier object-oriented extension to Icon, Idol,
can be found in the Icon program library.

<P><HR><H2>Support</H2>

<H3><A NAME="ugroup">D1.</A> Is there a users' group for Icon?</H3>
<P>
There is no official Icon users' group, but
The Icon Project maintains a moderated "Icon-group" electronic mailing list.
To subscribe (or unsubscribe), send a message to
<A HREF="mailto:icon-group-request@cs.arizona.edu">
icon-group-request@cs.arizona.edu</A>.
<P>
There is a gateway between Icon-group and
<A HREF="news:comp.lang.icon">comp.lang.icon</A>,
an unmoderated newsgroup for discussing issues related to Icon.
The gateway, which exchanges messages between the two systems,
is imperfect and not under the control of the Icon Project.
<P>
The newsgroup generally provides faster response than the mailing list and
is less intrusive, but it sometimes suffers from inappropriate postings. The
Icon Project usually sends its announcements and other messages
to the mailing list.

<H3><A NAME="techsupport">D2.</A> How do I get technical support?</H3>
The Icon Project is not a commercial organization, and its capacity for
providing technical support is limited. Please use the appropriate resource
when you need assistance:

<P><HR><H2>Programming</H2>

<H3><A NAME="evread">E1.</A>
Why doesn't <CODE>read()</CODE> work with <CODE>every</CODE>?</H3>
<P>
<CODE>every s := read() do {...}</CODE>
doesn't loop because <CODE>read()</CODE> produces a single value and
then fails if resumed.
Other "consumer" procedures such as <CODE>get()</CODE> and <CODE>pop()</CODE>
work the same way.
Use a <CODE>while</CODE> loop with these procedures, and save
<CODE>every</CODE> for use with generators such as <CODE>!x</CODE>
or <CODE>key(T)</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="strinv">E2.</A>
Why doesn't string invocation such as <CODE>"foo"()</CODE> work?</H3>
<P>
String invocation works if the procedure is present;
the catch is that the linker removes unreferenced procedures.
To ensure a procedure's presence, reference it in the
<CODE>main()</CODE> procedure.
A simple reference suffices, as in
<CODE>refs := [foo, bar, baz]</CODE>;
it's not necessary to actually call it.
<P>
(Why does the linker remove unreferenced procedures?
Because this can save <EM>huge</EM> amounts of memory for
programs that use the library.)

<H3><A NAME="callc">E3.</A> How can I call a C function?</H3>
<P>
You can't call an arbitrary C function, 
but if you're willing to write a function to Icon's specifications,
there are two approaches.
Under Unix, which provides <CODE>loadfunc()</CODE>,
you can load one or more functions from a shared library,
and afterwards treat them as if they had been written in Icon.
Some examples can be found in the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/library/ccfuncs.htm">
<CODE>cfuncs</CODE></A> and
<CODE>packs/loadfuncs</CODE> directories of the Icon program library.
The more cumbersome approach is to add code to the Icon interpreter
and rebuild it; some hooks are provided for this purpose.
Both approaches are discussed in <CITE>Calling C Functions from Icon</CITE>,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/docs/ipd240.htm">
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/docs/ipd240.htm</A>.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/jcon/">Jcon</A> implementation
allows Icon programs to call Java code that is written to Jcon specifications.

<H3><A NAME="rwpipe">E4.</A> Can I open a bidirectional pipe?</H3>
<P>
No, this is not possible.
Although the concept is simple -- 
write a line to a program via a pipe, then read that program's output
-- it probably wouldn't work.
Most I/O libraries don't write anything to a pipe until
they've filled a buffer, and the most likely consequence would be
a deadlock, with each program waiting for the other to send more data.
