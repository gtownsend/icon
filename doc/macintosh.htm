  <H2>Introduction</H2>

  <P>Because Mac OS X is based on Unix, it can run Icon. There is
  no special Macintosh interface, so as a practical matter Icon on
  the Mac is for those who are comfortable using a Unix shell in a
  Terminal window.</P>

  <P>The command-line interface to Icon is described by Unix
  <CITE>man</CITE> pages. The <CODE><A href=
  "icon.txt">icon</A></CODE> command executes a program from a
  single source file. An Icon program in a simple text file
  <CODE>prog.icn</CODE> is executed by typing <CODE>icon
  prog.icn</CODE>. The more general <CODE><A href=
  "icont.txt">icont</A></CODE> command, modeled after the Unix
  <CITE>cc</CITE> command, supports multiple files, separate
  compilation, and other features.</P>

  <H2>Co-Expressions</H2>

  <P>
  Because MacOS does not implement anonymous semaphores,
  each co-expression creates an open file.
  Programs with hundreds of active co-expressions may
  abort with a <CODE>cannot create semaphore</CODE> system error.
  The open file limit can be raised from the typical default of 256
  using a <CODE>limit descriptors <I>n</I></CODE> or
  <CODE>ulimit -nS <I>n</I></CODE> command, depending on the shell.


  <H2>Graphics</H2>

  <P> If Icon is built with graphics enabled, the X Window System
  (&ldquo;X11&rdquo;) is required to run any Icon program.
  X11 is not needed if Icon is built with graphics disabled.

  <P> Beginning with Mac OS 10.8 (&ldquo;Mountain Lion&rdquo;),
  X11 is not part of the standard OS installation. 
  When X11 is first needed, Mac OS provides instructions for
  downloading and installing it.
  After that is done, X11 starts automatically as needed.
  A ringed X icon appears in the dock when an Icon graphics program
  is run and persists innocuously afterward.

  <H2>Building Icon</H2>

  <P>Building Icon from source requires the <A href=
  "https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</A> toolbox,
  which is available for
  <A HREF="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">
  free download</A> with registration.</P>

  <P>Icon is built in a Terminal window. The process is the same as
  on other platforms and uses the configuration named
  <CODE>macintosh</CODE>. See
  <A href="build.htm">Building Icon</A> for detailed instructions.</P>
