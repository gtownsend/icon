<H1>Building Version 9.5 of Icon from Source</H1>

<H2> Introduction </H2>

<P> These instructions explain how to build and install the source code of
<A HREF=relnotes.htm>Version 9.5 of Icon</A> under Unix.
For instructions on installing a binary release, see
<A HREF=install.htm>Installing Icon Binaries</A>.

<P> These instructions assume that you have unpacked the Icon 
distribution file into a directory.
All commands are issued in that directory.

<H2> Configuring </H2>

<P> The Icon source package contains configurations for a variety of
Unix platforms.
Type <CODE>make Configure</CODE> to see the list of known configurations.
A status report for any system can be viewed by entering
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>make Status name=</CODE><VAR>name</VAR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Choose the configuration name that matches your system's
operating system, and be sure to note
any special considerations given in its status report.

<P><SMALL> (If your system is not among those listed, you will need to
port the code.  
This is usually a fairly simple matter that involves copying an existing
configuration and editing it to match the target system.
See <A HREF=port.htm>Porting Icon</A>.)
</SMALL>

<P> Most Unix systems include the X11 window system; type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>make X-Configure name=</CODE><VAR>name</VAR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
to configure Icon with graphics.
If your computer does not have the X window system, type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>make Configure name=</CODE><VAR>name</VAR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
to configure Icon without graphics.

<P> Installation using any of the supplied configurations <EM>should</EM>
be routine, but some of those were contributed for systems we cannot test,
and it is possible that some minor tweaking may be required.
If so, or if you develop a new configuration, we'd like to hear about it
by e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:icon-project@cs.arizona.edu">icon-project@cs.arizona.edu</A>.

<H2> Building </H2> 

<P> After Configuring, type <CODE>make</CODE> to build the Icon system.
This single step builds:
<UL>
    <LI> The Icon translator and interpreter
    <LI> Program library procedures
    <LI> VIB and other graphics utilities, if graphics are enabled
</UL>

<P> There may be a few warnings on some platforms, but there should be
no fatal errors.
If there are problems,
fix them in the <CODE>config/</CODE><VAR>platform</VAR>
directory and repeat the configuration step.

<H2> Testing </H2> 

<P> To verify a successful build, type <CODE>make Test</CODE>.
This command compiles and executes a series of Icon programs,
comparing their outputs with a set of standard results.
A normal run concludes with the phrase "All tests passed."

<P> A successful graphics build can be confirmed by executing
<CODE>bin/colrbook</CODE>, the color book utility, with no arguments.
It should display a spectrum of colors along the left and a set
of recessed panes to the right.
Click anywhere on the spectrum to fill colors in the panes.
Click <CODE>QUIT</CODE> (in the upper left corner) to exit.

<H2> Installing </H2> 

<P> Icon can be run directly from the location in which it was built.
To do this, simply add the <CODE>bin</CODE> directory to your shell's
search path.
See the man pages for <A HREF=icon.txt><CODE>icon</CODE></A>
and <A HREF=icont.txt><CODE>icont</CODE></A>
for instructions on building and running Icon programs.

<P> If you wish to install the binaries elsewhere,
choose a location for a directory dedicated to Icon &mdash;
for example, <CODE>/opt/icon</CODE> or <CODE>/usr/local/icon</CODE>.
If you are replacing an existing directory, delete the old one first.
Enter
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE>make Install dest=</CODE><VAR>directory</VAR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
to create <VAR>directory</VAR> and install Icon in its
<CODE>bin</CODE>, <CODE>lib</CODE>,
<CODE>doc</CODE>, and <CODE>man</CODE> subdirectories.
All files are created using the default permissions
<CITE>(umask)</CITE> of the current user.

<P> You can make symbolic links from other locations
to programs in the Icon <CODE>bin</CODE> directory.
For example, you can link
<CODE>/usr/local/bin/icon</CODE> to <CODE>/opt/icon/bin/icon</CODE>.
If you do this, link all of <CODE>icon</CODE>, <CODE>icont</CODE>,
<CODE>iconx</CODE>, and (if present) <CODE>vib</CODE>.

<P> If you'd like to bundle up a gzipped tar file of the binaries
created by the build process, enter <CODE>make Package</CODE>.
Such a package can be used to install binaries on other 
systems of the same architecture.

<H2> Cleaning Up </H2>

<P> Type <CODE>make Clean</CODE> to remove intermediate files created
during the build process.  This command preserves the contents of the
<CODE>bin</CODE> and <CODE>lib</CODE> directories, so the built system
remains functional.

<P> To restore everything to its original state, type <CODE>make Pure</CODE>.
This removes all the configuration information and newly built files.
