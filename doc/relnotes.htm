<H2> Introduction </H2>

<P> Version 9.4.3 of Icon is a minor update to version 9.4.2 of Icon. 
It incorporates configuration, documentation, and library updates.
Some minor bugs have been fixed.

<P> The Icon language is unchanged, and this Unix implementation
remains compatible at the source level with Icon 9.3 for Windows.


<H2> Changes in version 9.4.3 </H2>

<P> Notable changes in this latest version are listed here.
Some code cleanup work and documentation editing
has also been done.

<H3> Configurations </H3>

<P> The system-specific Icon configurations have been reorganized and renamed;
new names focus on operating systems rather than CPU architectures.
The several BSD configurations have been merged into one.

<P> The <CODE>macintosh</CODE> configuration now supports the
<CODE>loadfunc</CODE> function.  This configuration has also been
revised to anticipate Apple's announced change to x86-based systems.

<P> A new <A HREF=port.htm>porting guide</A> has been written, and a new
"posix" configuration has been introduced as a starting point for new ports.

<H3> Library changes </H3>

<P> As usual, several files in the Icon program library have been
added or edited.  The core library files, however, remain stable.
Notable changes include:

<PRE>
procs/dijkstra		new procedures implement Dijkstra's control structures
procs/html		add procedure for canonicalization of paths
procs/printf		add %e format and fix a rounding problem

progs/noise		new program for producing a random bitstream
progs/unclog		improve logic for combining adjacent entries

gprogs/dlgvu		better placement of quadrangle labels
gprogs/gallery		faster thumbnail loading for JPEG images
gprogs/img		many new features
gprogs/sier		better color choices
</PRE>

The undocumented <CODE>save</CODE> function, which only worked
on a few platforms, has been removed.


<H2> Earlier feature additions </H2>

<P> New features added since the publication of the Icon books
are described below.

<H3> Millions of colors </H3>
<SMALL> (new with version 9.4.2 of Icon) </SMALL>

<P> Icon's X-windows interface no longer limits each window to
256 colors at one time.
Median-cut quantization selects image colors when writing a GIF file.

<H3> Scriptable source files </H3>
<SMALL> (new with version 9.4.1 of Icon) </SMALL>

<P> An Icon source file can be made executable under Unix by prefixing it
with a comment line
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>#!/usr/bin/env icon</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
and setting its execute permission bit.
This uses a new <A HREF="icon.txt"><CODE>icon</CODE></A> command,
which in another form allows a small Icon program to be embedded
within a shell script.
See the <A HREF="icon.txt">man page</A> for details.
The traditional <A HREF="icont.txt"><CODE>icont</CODE></A> command
remains available for less specialized purposes.

<H3> Path searching </H3>
<SMALL> (new with version 9.4.0 of Icon) </SMALL>

<P> Under Unix, colons (<CODE>:</CODE>) may now separate directories in the
<CODE>LPATH</CODE> and <CODE>IPATH</CODE> environment variables as an
alternative to spaces.
The Icon translator and linker search these paths when looking for
<CODE>$include</CODE> and <CODE>link</CODE> files respectively.

<P> The Icon program library is now searched automatically, but
<CODE>LPATH</CODE> and <CODE>IPATH</CODE> can still be set to control
the search order.
For version 9.4, the effective path in each case is:
<OL>
	<LI> The current directory
	<LI> Any directories named by the environment variable
	<LI> The Icon library directory
</OL>

<P> Other changes affect the configuration of Icon at installation time
and the way executable Icon programs locate the interpreter.
These changes, which are transparent to most users, are discussed
in more detail on the <A HREF="files.htm">File Organization</A> page.

<H3> Reading directory contents </H3>
<SMALL> (new with version 9.3.2 of Icon) </SMALL>

<P> The files in a directory can be listed by opening the directory as a file.
Subsequent reads return the names of the files contained in the directory.
The names are returned in no particular order, and for Unix, the directories 
<CODE>"."</CODE> and <CODE>".."</CODE> are included.

<H3> Reading foreign text files </H3> 
<SMALL> (new with version 9.3.1 of Icon) </SMALL>

<P> The function <CODE>read()</CODE> recognizes
three kinds of line terminators when reading a file
opened in translated mode:
Windows (CR+LF), Macintosh (CR), or Unix (LF).
Consequently, text files created on one platform can be
read by an Icon program running on a different platform. 


<H2> Limitations, bugs, and problems </H2>

<P> Large integers cannot be used with <CODE>i to j</CODE>,
with <CODE>seq()</CODE>, or with integer-valued keywords.

<P> Large-integer literals are constructed at run-time, so such
literals are best kept outside of loops.

<P> Conversion of a large integer to a string is quadratic
in the length of the integer.
Conversion of a very large integer may take a long time.

<P> An "evaluation stack overflow" can occur when a procedure is called
with a huge number (thousands or more) of arguments.
The capacity can be increased by setting the environment variable
<CODE>MSTKSIZE</CODE> or <CODE>COEXPSIZE</CODE>, as appropriate.

<P> Stack overflow checking uses a heuristic that is not always effective.
Stack overflow in a co-expression is especially likely to escape
detection and cause a mysterious program malfunction. 

<P> Pathologically nested structures can provoke a memory or segmentation
fault during garbage collection by reaching the stack limit.
The stack limit can be raised by the 
<CODE>limit</CODE> or <CODE>ulimit</CODE> shell command.


<P> If an expression such as <CODE> x := create <VAR>expr</VAR></CODE>
is used in a loop, and <CODE>x</CODE> is not a global variable,
uncollectable co-expressions accumulate with each iteration.
This problem can be circumvented by making <CODE>x</CODE>
a global variable or by assigning a value to <CODE>x</CODE>
before the create operation, as in 
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	x := &amp;null <BR>
	x := create <VAR>expr</VAR>
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Integer overflow on exponentiation may not be detected during execution.
Such overflow may occur during type conversion.

<P> For installation instructions, see
<A HREF=install.htm>Installing Binaries</A> or
<A HREF=build.htm>Building from Source</A> as appropriate.
