MODIFICATION CHECKLIST
<<ARIZONA-ONLY>>

Icon maintenance has evolved from infrequent formal releases to a system of
continual modifications that are immediately available publicly through GitHub.
When a set of changes is ready to go:

Set the version number and date (for &version) in src/h/version.h.
The date should be the date of modification, i.e. today's date.
The version number should be of the form  9.5.yyx  where
	yy is the last two digits of today's year
	x is an alphabetic sequence character within the year (a,b,c,...)

Do full rebuilds and tests, both with and without graphics.
Do this on multiple architectures if warranted by non-trivial edits.
Verify the appearance of &version as printed by the tests.
Check in the changes.
Set a Git "annotated" tag of the form "v9.5.yyx" (note the leading v):
	git tag -a "v9.5.yyx" -m "fix xxx yyy problem on zzz"
Push the mods *with the tag*:
	git push
	git push --tags

Send an announcement to the Icon-language mailing list if warranted.
Consider whether any Icon web pages need updating for
-- significant news on the front page
-- changes to FAQ or other documentation which is mirrored on the website
-- IPL changes warranting a rebuild of online documentation
